"Bridge the Gap"

Blogs Website for Colleges
Colleges all over the world conduct various hackathons, seminars and interesting events all the time. As a student , it is it difficult to track and keep a note of several such events at a time.

That's where BRIDGE comes in.
Our aim is to BRIDGE THE GAP between universities and a student. We have created a website that allows colleges to post about the events, hackathons, and in general any important news of their college which has to be conveyed to a mass populace.
