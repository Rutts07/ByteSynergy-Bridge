Thank you for checking out Bridge!
We are glad to be the first creators of one such website.  We tried our hands on this project as we as students find it difficult to manage and keep a track of events and happenings of other colleges, we are interested in. 
That's where BRIDGE comes in.
Looking ahead, we plan to accelerate the implementation of our expansion strategy while maintaining the strength of our websiteâ€”in assisting our clients in sharing information and creating innovation, as well as delivering positive change to the communities in which we work and live. We're very thrilled about this journey and believe the best is yet to come for BRIDGE.

            Our aim is to BRIDGE THE GAP between universities and a student. We have created a website that allows colleges to post about the events, hackathons, and in general any important news of their college which has to be conveyed to a mass populace.
